# Machine Learning In Image Processing Project
Project for the subject PA228 - Machine learning in image processing

Objectives:

1. Study state-of-the-art approaches to solving your task. Refer to at least three ML IP papers on this topic. Using your own words introduce the basic ideas of each approach.

2. Pick one of the methods and implement it by yourself. You can alternatively make some improvements in the method you choose, but then add also reasoning supporting novelty. Respect the honor code, and list all your resources and collaborations.

3. Evaluate the model performance. Compare the results with a non-trivial baseline model. Show that your model is properly trained. If you are bringing any improvements to standard techniques, do not forget to validate the benefits.

4. Report your experience with the task. List difficulties and future works for your project. The report can be written as a Jupyter notebook or as formatted text.
